/// Manages health, damage reception, and death mechanics for game entities.

/// This component provides a comprehensive health system that handles damage
/// reception, knockback effects, visual feedback, and death processing. It
/// implements the IDamageable interface to integrate with the combat system
/// and provides a foundation for entity survivability mechanics.
/// 
/// Key features:
/// - Health point management with damage reduction
/// - Directional knockback based on damage source
/// - Heavy damage detection with enhanced effects
/// - Visual effect integration for damage feedback
/// - Death state management and entity cleanup
/// - Configurable knockback parameters for game feel tuning
/// 
/// The system supports both light and heavy damage types, with heavy damage
/// triggering enhanced knockback effects when damage exceeds a configurable
/// threshold percentage of current health.
