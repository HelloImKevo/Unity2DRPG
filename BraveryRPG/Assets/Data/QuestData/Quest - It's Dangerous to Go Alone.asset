  description: Since you're just startin' your adventure, you'll need somethin' to
    train with. I bought a sword off some weird fella - looked half mad, but the
    blade was decent. Wait, where'd I put it? Agh, right! Forgot it at Joe's. Go
    talk to the Blacksmith - he's holdin' onto a weapon worthy of a hero like you!
  questGoal: '- Talk to Blacksmith Joe'
